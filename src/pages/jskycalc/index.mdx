## Installing JSkyCalc on macOS
<hr/>
<br/>

### 1. Download .jar File

Go to [John Thorstensen's][2] GitHub page and download the `JSkyCalc.jar` executable jar file.

<br/>

### 2. Create a New Directory in Home Folder

I suggest creating a new folder in your home directory and placing the jar file in there. If your jar file is in your Downloads folder after downloading from John's site, you can copy paste the three commands to your terminal and you should end up in your `jskycalc` directory, under your home folder.

```bash
mkdir ~/jskycalc
```

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/JSkyCalc.jar ~/jskycalc
```

```bash
cd ~/jskycalc
```

<br/>

### 3. Install Oracle-Java JDK Download

Run the java command on the jar file and it should start right up. If you don't have java installed in your system you will get a messege:

```bash
The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.
Please visit http://www.java.com for information on installing Java.
```

Do not go to Java.com. Instead use this link [Oracle-Java][1].  Click on "Arm 64 DMG Installer" option from **Java SE 18** section and then download the `jdk-18_macos-aarch64_bin.dmg` file. Double-click on the DMG file you downloaded and follow install instructions.

```bash
java -jar JSkyCalc.jar
```

<br/>

<br/><br/>

### 4. Unpack Files from Jar File

To add Mount Laguna Observatory to JSkyCalc, start by unpacking the jar file.

```bash
jar -xvf JSkyCalc.jar
```

<br/>

### 5. Add a New Site Location as Default

Open `skycalcsites.dat` and add Mount Laguna Observatory as the first site (above Kitt Peak)--it will become the default.

```bash
"Mount Laguna Obs.", 7.76173, 32.84, 8., 1, "Pacific", "P", 1859., 1859.
```

<br/>

<br/>

### 6. Save Changes to Jar File

Reconstruct the jar file and all the changes will take effect.

```bash
jar -cvmf myManifest.mf JSkyCalc.jar .
```

<br/>

### 7. Environment setup

Add following lines to your `~/.bash_profile` file and you will be able to start JSkyCalc from any directory.

```bash
# use jsky command in any directory to start JSkyCalc
alias jsky='java JSkyCalc'
CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/JSkyCalc
export CLASSPATH
```

<br/>

Finally, use the command `source ~/.bash_profile` to source the file and then use jsky command to start using JSkyCalc from any directory! 

<br/>

### 8. Sky Objetcs to Target

The following line is the general format for JSkyCalc (.dat) files:

```bash
Name_no_blanks hh mm ss dd mm ss equinox +++
```

<br/>

It's fine if all your stars have equinox=2000. Here is an example of `observe-star.dat` formatted for JSkyCalc.

```bash
some_star 00 37 52.92 -09 42 16.5 2000.0 +++
```
